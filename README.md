# elk-docker

ELK stack in Docker, with documentation issues fixed.

## info

This repo adds nothing different other than having a working example of the `docker-compose` setup described [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-docker.html), the way I wanted it.
